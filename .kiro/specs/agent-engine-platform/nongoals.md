## Non‑Goals

The platform does not attempt to auto‑generate arbitrary new tools; it integrates with existing ecosystems instead. It is not a general workflow orchestrator or ETL platform. It does not provide multi‑tenant hard isolation at the database level; isolation is logical with strict authZ. On‑device inference and training are out of scope. Full text search is limited to database indices; external vector stores are optional and not required.
