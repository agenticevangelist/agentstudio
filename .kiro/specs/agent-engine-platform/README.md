## Agent Engine Platform Specs

This directory contains the finalized specification set for the Agent Engine Platform. The specs are organized by topic and reflect the state of the system as implemented.

Sections include architecture, APIs, data models, design decisions, delivery processes, security and compliance, testing strategy, and operations. Each document is written to stand alone and can be read independently.

If you are looking for a quick entry point, start with `architecture/overview.md` and then jump to `api/backend.md` and `data/schema.md`.
