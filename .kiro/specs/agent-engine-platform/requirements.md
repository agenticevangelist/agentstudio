# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Agent Studio Platform is a full-stack application for building, deploying, and managing AI agents with integrated third-party app connections. The platform enables users to create custom AI agents with specific purposes, connect them to external services via Composio's unified API, implement human-in-the-loop workflows for safe automation, and manage background automations that work continuously. The system provides real-time chat interfaces, knowledge management capabilities, and comprehensive audit trails for agent actions.

5. WHEN multiple jobs run concurrently THEN the system SHALL handle them independently with proper resource isolation
6. WHEN a job fails THEN the system SHALL capture error details and provide debugging information

### Requirement 7: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Workflows

**User Story:** As a user, I want to review and approve critical agent actions before they execute, so that I maintain control over sensitive operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent encounters a decision point THEN the system SHALL create an interrupt request with action details and configuration options
2. WHEN an interrupt occurs THEN the system SHALL pause the workflow and create an InboxItem with status "waiting_human"
