## Sequence Flows

### Chat Message to Tool Call

1. UI sends user message -> API persists message + run event.
2. API enqueues Celery task -> Worker plans steps.
3. Worker invokes Composio tool -> emits tool_start.
4. Provider responds -> emits tool_end with payload.
5. Worker synthesizes agent reply -> streams tokens.
6. Final output persisted -> run completes.

### Retry on Transient Error

1. Tool call fails with retriable code.
2. Worker retries with exponential backoff and idempotency key.
3. Duplicate detection shortâ€‘circuits if provider already executed.
4. Events reflect retry attempt count for UI transparency.
